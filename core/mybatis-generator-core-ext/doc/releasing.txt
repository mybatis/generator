Releasing MyBatis Generator
===========================

Core Release Process
====================

Setup encrypted server passwords for Maven as shown here:

   http://code.google.com/p/mybatis/wiki/ProcessRelease
   
Also, make sure that SVN and GPG are in your path, and that your gpg key
has been published properly.

1. (optional) mvn release:prepare -DdryRun=true

   Make sure the new POMs look OK (pom.xml.next and pom.xml.tag)
   
2. (if you did #1) mvn release:clean

3. mvn release:prepare [-Dusername=xxx -Dpassword=xxx]

The username and password properties are only required if you have not saved
your SVN authentication information.

This build might fail if the the newly versioned artifacts don't get installed
in the local repository properly.  If so, then run "mvn install" for the individual
projects: core, maven-plugin, systests-common (in that order).  Then, resume the
release with

  mvn release:prepare -Dresume=true [-Dusername=xxx -Dpassword=xxx]

4. mvn release:perform

This step should upload to sonatype, as well as uploading the core bundle to google code.  If
the google upload fails, you will need to upload the bundle manually.

5. On google code, set the prior version of the generator to deprecated

6. Log in to sonatype at http://oss.sonatype.org

Go to "staging repositories" - you should see the uploaded artifacts.
Close, and then release the staging repository.

7. Update the DTD on the site if required

8. Send out the announcement notice

Eclipse Release Process
=======================

1. Build the new version of the Eclipse feature:
  - Increment the version number of the feature
  - Increment the version number of any plugin that has changed
  - Add the new version to the category.xml in the build project
  - Run the build.xml script in the build project (creates a new feature version
    at \temp\mybatis.generator.build\etc.)
  
2. Install a fresh version of Eclipse, and install the new version of the feature
   from \temp\mybatis.generator.build\buildRepo.  Run through the manual test
   scripts for the Eclipse feature

3. If everything is OK, run the publish.xml script in the build project.
   This will merge the new plugin into the update site.
  
4. Commit the update site

5. Update the wiki with new version information

6. Send out the announcement notice
