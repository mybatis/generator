/**
 * This interface defines methods that will be called at different times during
 * the code generation process. These methods can be used to extend or modify
 * the generated code. Clients may implement this interface in its entirety, or
 * extend the PluginAdapter (highly recommended).
 * 
 * <p>Plugins have a lifecycle. In general, the lifecycle is this:
 * 
 * <ol>
 * <li>The setXXX methods are called one time</li>
 * <li>The validate method is called one time</li>
 * <li>The initialized method is called for each introspected table</li>
 * <li>The clientXXX methods are called for each introspected table</li>
 * <li>The providerXXX methods are called for each introspected table</li>
 * <li>The modelXXX methods are called for each introspected table</li>
 * <li>The sqlMapXXX methods are called for each introspected table</li>
 * <li>The contextGenerateAdditionalJavaFiles(IntrospectedTable) method is
 * called for each introspected table</li>
 * <li>The contextGenerateAdditionalXmlFiles(IntrospectedTable) method is called
 * for each introspected table</li>
 * <li>The contextGenerateAdditionalJavaFiles() method is called one time</li>
 * <li>The contextGenerateAdditionalXmlFiles() method is called one time</li>
 * </ol>
 * 
 * <p>Plugins are related to contexts - so each context will have its own set of
 * plugins. If the same plugin is specified in multiple contexts, then each
 * context will hold a unique instance of the plugin.
 * 
 * <p>Plugins are called, and initialized, in the same order they are specified in
 * the configuration.
 * 
 * <p>The clientXXX, modelXXX, and sqlMapXXX methods are called by the code
 * generators. If you replace the default code generators with other
 * implementations, these methods may not be called.
