<h1>Oracle Usage Notes</h1>
<h2>Public Synonyms</h2>
<p>If you want to generate objects for a table that has a public synonym, you
should actually generate the objects against the real table - and then change the
table name at runtime.  MyBatis Generator supports this automatically.</p>
<p>For example, assume there is a public alias "FRED" that points to the
table "HR.EMPLOYEES".  The following table configuration will generate the objects
based on HR.EMPLOYEES, but the runtime SQL will only refer to FRED:</p>
<pre>
  &lt;table schema="HR" tableName="EMPLOYEES"&gt;
    &lt;property name="ignoreQualifiersAtRuntime" value="true" /&gt;
    &lt;property name="runtimeTableName" value="FRED" /&gt;
  &lt;/table&gt;
</pre>
<h2>Oracle LONG Datatype</h2>
<p>The Oracle JDBC driver will report that a LONG column is JDBC type LONGVARCHAR.
MyBatis will map LONGVARCHAR to CLOB which is unsupported by the Oracle driver.
So, when using LONG datatype, you should do a column override in the generator
to map it to VARCHAR JDBC type.</p>
