Releasing Ibator
================

Core Release Process
====================

This process is similar to what is show at http://maven.apache.org/developers/release/apache-release.html
except that Ibator is not using the nexus repository manager, so the deployment
steps are different (and we are not publishing snapshot versions).

1. mvn release:prepare -DdryRun=true

   Make sure the new POMs look OK (pom.xml.next and pom.xml.tag)
   
2. mvn release:clean

3. mvn release:prepare -Dusername=xxx -Dpassword=xxx

4. mvn deploy -DaltDeploymentRepository=local::default::file:/temp/IbatorDeploy

5. scp the new artifacts to /www/people.apache.org/repo/m2-ibiblio-rsync-repository/org/apache/ibatis/ibator/etc.


Eclipse Release Process
=======================

1. Build the new version of the Eclipse feature:
  - Increment the version number of the feature
  - Increment the version number of any plugin that has changed
  - Run the build.xml script in the build project (creates a new feature version
    at \temp\ibator.build\etc.)
  - Add the new feature and plugin jars to the IbatorUpdateSite project

    project (manually)
