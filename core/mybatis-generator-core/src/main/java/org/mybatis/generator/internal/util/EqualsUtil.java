/**
 * This class is from javapractices.com:
 * 
 * http://www.javapractices.com/Topic17.cjp
 * 
 * Collected methods which allow easy implementation of <code>equals</code>.
 * 
 * Example use case in a class called Car:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * public boolean equals(Object that) {
 *     if (this == that)
 *         return true;
 *     if (!(that instanceof Car))
 *         return false;
 *     Car thatCar = (Car) that;
 *     return EqualsUtil.areEqual(this.fName, that.fName)
 *             &amp;&amp; EqualsUtil.areEqual(this.fNumDoors, that.fNumDoors)
 *             &amp;&amp; EqualsUtil.areEqual(this.fGasMileage, that.fGasMileage)
 *             &amp;&amp; EqualsUtil.areEqual(this.fColor, that.fColor)
 *             &amp;&amp; Arrays.equals(this.fMaintenanceChecks, that.fMaintenanceChecks); //array!
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <em>Arrays are not handled by this class</em>. This is because the
 * <code>Arrays.equals</code> methods should be used for array fields.
