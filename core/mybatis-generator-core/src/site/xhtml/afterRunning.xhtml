<h1>Tasks After Running MyBatis Generator</h1>
<p>After you run MyBatis Generator (MBG), you will need to create or modify
   other MyBatis configuration
   artifacts.  The main task is to create or modify a MapperConfig.xml file.</p>

<h2>Updating the MapperConfig.xml File (MyBatis 3.x)</h2>
<p>MyBatis 3.x uses an XML file, commonly named <code>MapperConfig.xml</code>,
to specify
information for a database connection, a transaction management scheme, and XML mapper
files that will be used in a MyBatis session.  MBG cannot create this file for you
because it knows nothing about your execution environment.  However, some of the
items in this file relate directly to MBG generated items.  Please refer to
the standard MyBatis data mapper developer guide for details about the different
configuration options.</p>

<p>MBG specific needs in the configuration file are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>MBG generated XML mapper files must be listed</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, suppose that MBG has generated an XML mapper file called
<code>MyTableMapper.xml</code>, and that the file has been placed in the
<code>test.xml</code> package
of your project.  The <code>MapperConfig.xml</code> file should have these entries:</p>
<pre>
  &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
  &lt;!DOCTYPE configuration
    PUBLIC "-//mybatis.org//DTD Config 3.0//EN"
    "http://mybatis.org/dtd/mybatis-3-config.dtd"&gt;

  &lt;configuration&gt;
    &lt;!-- Setup the transaction manager and data source that are
         appropriate for your environment
    --&gt;
    &lt;environments default"..."&gt;
      &lt;environment id"..."&gt;
        &lt;transactionManager type="..."&gt;
        &lt;/transactionManager&gt;
        &lt;dataSource type="..."&gt;
        &lt;/dataSource&gt;
      &lt;/environment&gt;
    &lt;/environments&gt;

    &lt;mappers&gt;
      &lt;!-- XML mapper files should be listed here --&gt;
      &lt;mapper resource="test/xml/MyTable_SqlMap.xml" /&gt;
    &lt;/mappers&gt;

  &lt;/configuration&gt;
</pre>

<p>If there is more than one XML mapper file (as is quite common),
then the files can be listed in any order with repeated <code>&lt;mapper&gt;</code>
elements after the <code>&lt;mappers&gt;</code> element.</p>

<p><b>Generated MapperConfig.xml</b> You may ask
MBG to generate a skeleton Mapper Configuration file with the MapperConfigPlugin.
See the <a href="configreference/plugin.html">&lt;plugin&gt;</a>
page for more information.</p>
