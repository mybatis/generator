<h1>Migrating from Ibator</h1>
<p>This page details changes between MyBatis Generator (MBG)
and Ibator.  For most users, the changes should be simple.
If you extended any of Ibator's classes to supply custom implementations
of code generators or the Java type resolver, you will need to rework
those custom classes.</p>
<p>Changes
are described assuming you are using XML configuration for MBG.  If you
are using Java based configuration, then the changes are still required
and should be easy to deduce from the description of the XML changes.</p>
