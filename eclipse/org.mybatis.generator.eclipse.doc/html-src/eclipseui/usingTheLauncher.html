<h1>Using the Launcher</h1>
<p>The MyBatis Generator feature includes a custom launcher for
running MyBatis generator.  The launcher leverages Eclipse's launch support
and enables you to create any number of custom launches.  The launcher has far
more capability than the previous popup menu action.  Further, the launch support
does not alter the Eclipse IDE classpath - which could happen inadvertently with
the prior popup menu action.</p>
<p>While a code generation is running, the Eclipse progress view will show the progress of the
generation run.  The launch will also create a new MyBatis Generator console view that shows status messages
and any warnings from the run.  If you configure logging to log to the console, then logging messages
will also be in the MyBatis Generator console.</p>
<p>On this page we will cover some of the technical internals of the launcher.
We assume you are familiar with how the Eclipse launch support works in general.
If you are not familiar with Eclipse launching, just know that launch configurations
can be accessed with the Run&gt;Run Configurations... or Run&gt;Debug Configurations...
menu options.</p>

<h2>Working with the Classpath</h2>
<p>The launcher allows you to add entries to the runtime classpath
of the launch.  Classpath entries should be added for the following things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>JDBC drivers used during code generation and when running SQL scripts</li>
  <li>Logging implementations if you want to use Slf4j, Log4j, Log4j2, or Jakarta commons logging</li>
  <li>If you are developing a plugin, you can add the plugin project to the classpath for testing
      (If you are developing a plugin, you do not need to add MyBatis Generator
      itself to the launch classpath as it will already be added by the launcher)</li>
</ul>
<p>The launcher will automatically add the Java project containing the configuration file to the
classpath.</p>
<p>Adding entries to the launcher classpath is generally preferable to using
a <code>&lt;classPathEntry&gt;</code> configuration element in the generator
configuration file.  However, if you use a dependency JAR that relies on native code
(such as some DB2 drivers) it would be better to use the  
<code>&lt;classPathEntry&gt;</code> configuration element.  This because native
code can only be loaded by a single classloader and it is likely that
the generator classloader will be garbage collected before the launch classloader.</p>

<h2>What's Different in a Debug Launch?</h2>
<p>If you launch in debug mode, rather than run mode, the launcher will
launch Ant in debug mode and will log all messages to
a the MyBatis Generator console.  This can be useful when
using an SQL script as you will be able to see the script progress in the
console.  You will also see many Ant configuration messages.</p>
<p>Currently the launcher does not support breakpoints in dependent projects.
If you are developing a plugin you may add the plugin project to the launcher
classpath and the plugin will be executed, but any breakpoints set in
plugin code will be ignored.  This is a limitation of Ant support.</p>

<h2>Launcher Internals</h2>
<p>Internally the launcher uses the MyBatis Generator Ant task to run the generator.  The
launcher creates an Ant build script based on attributes in the launch
configuration and then uses Eclipse's Ant support to run the script.</p>
<p>The launch configuration allows you to specify a SQL script to run
before the generator is run.  This can be useful when using in-memory databases
and is used during testing of the feature.  Running a SQL script is accomplished
by using Ant's built in
SQL task to run a script you specify.  See the Ant documentation for details
about the capabilities of the SQL task.</p>

<h2>How Passwords are Stored</h2>
<p>If you specify a password for connecting to a database with the Ant script, you
have options on how that password is stored.</p>
<p>If you select the check box specifying that
credentials should be stored in secure storage, then the user ID and password will
be stored in Eclipse's internal secure storage system.  The password will be encrypted
using Eclipse's default support.  The password will be in clear text in the generated Ant
script while the launch is running, but the generated Ant file will be deleted after the
launch completes.</p>
<p>If you do not select the check box specifying that
credentials should be stored in secure storage, then the user ID and password will
be stored in clear text in the Eclipse launch configuration.  The password will also
be in clear text in the generated Ant script while the launch is running, and the
generated Ant file will not be deleted after the launch completes.</p>
<p>Launch configuration files are stored in<br/>
<code>&lt;workspace-directory&gt;/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.debug.core/.launches</code>
</p>
<p>The generated Ant files are stored in<br/>
<code>&lt;workspace-directory&gt;/.metadata/.plugins/org.mybatis.generator.eclipse.ui/.generatedAntScripts</code>
