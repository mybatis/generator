<h1>What's New in MyBatis Generator</h1>
<section><a id="Version_1.4.3"></a>
<h2>Version 1.4.3</h2>

<p>
  This is a relatively minor release.
  In this release we have updated the minimum Java version to 17.
  See the GitHub page for milestone 1.4.3 for details other changes in this release:
  <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mybatis/generator/issues?q=milestone%3A1.4.3" class="externalLink">Milestone 1.4.3</a>.
</p>

<section><a id="Enhancements.2FFixes"></a>
<h3>Enhancements/Fixes</h3>

<ul>
  
<li>Java 17 is now the minimum supported Java version</li>
  
<li>Added several missing modifiers to the Kotlin DSL</li>
  
<li>Fixed a rendering bug when Java types have wildcard bounds</li>
  
<li>Added a missing plugin method for the Dynamic SQL runtime</li>
</ul>

</section></section><section><a id="Version_1.4.2"></a>
<h2>Version 1.4.2</h2>

<p>This is a small maintenance release. The most visible change is the switch to the &quot;jakarta&quot; namespace
  and away from &quot;javax&quot;. See the GitHub page for milestone 1.4.2 for details other changes in this
  release:
  <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mybatis/generator/issues?q=milestone%3A1.4.2" class="externalLink">Milestone 1.4.2</a>.
</p>

<section><a id="Enhancements"></a>
<h3>Enhancements</h3>

<ul>
  
<li>The generator now uses annotations from the &quot;jakarta&quot; namespace in favor over the &quot;javax&quot; namespace. This is
    recommended for JDK 9+. If you prefer to use the &quot;javax&quot; annotations, there is a new property on the
    &lt;commentGenerator&gt; element that will override this behavior.
  </li>
  
<li>The Maven plugin now includes an integration with Eclipse Maven support. If you import a Maven project with the
    generator configured into an Eclipse workspace, the code generator will run automatically.
  </li>
  
<li>Added an &quot;info&quot; logging level to the log abstraction. Also removed the broken Maven logging implementation.
      Logging should now work as expected in Maven - Maven ships with the SLF4J simple logger in the classpath, so
      configuring logging in Maven will always use the SLF simple logger.
  </li>
  
<li>Added a new plugin method &quot;shouldGenerate&quot; that can be used to provide fine-grained filtering of tables in a
      context. Also added a new &quot;IgnoreViewsPlugin&quot; that filters out table type VIEW
  </li>
</ul>


</section></section><section><a id="Version_1.4.1"></a>
<h2>Version 1.4.1</h2>

<p>This release is primarily focused on updating the runtimes for MyBatis Dynamic SQL (&quot;MyBatis3DynamicSQL&quot; and
&quot;MyBatis3Kotlin&quot;). The generated code for &quot;MyBatis3DynamicSQL&quot; is now dependent on MyBatis Dynamic SQL version 1.3.1 or
later. The generated code for &quot;MyBatis3Kotlin&quot; is now dependent on MyBatis Dynamic SQL version 1.4.0 or later. See
below for details about these changes. See the GitHub page for milestone 1.4.1 for details other changes in this
release:
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mybatis/generator/issues?q=milestone%3A1.4.1" class="externalLink">Milestone 1.4.1</a>.</p>

<section><a id="Updated_MyBatis_Dynamic_SQL_Runtimes"></a>
<h3>Updated MyBatis Dynamic SQL Runtimes</h3>

<p>The MyBatis3DynamicSQL and MyBatis3Kotlin runtimes have been updated to generate code that requires updated versions
of MyBatis Dynamic SQL. Generated Java code requires version 1.3.1 or later, generated Kotlin code requires version
1.4.0 or later. This should be a relatively minor change for most <b>Java</b> users
and should simply require updating the MyBatis Dynamic SQL version to 1.3.1 or later.</p>


<p>For both Java and Kotlin users, the new database model classes (a.k.a. the &quot;support&quot; classes) now extend
    <code>AliasableSqlTable</code>. This allows you to specify a table alias directly within an instance
    of a table class, rather than specifying the alias in a select statement. This can make the code a bit clearer
    if you are doing a self join.
</p>


<p>Differences for <b>Kotlin</b> users are more extensive. As a result of the changes detailed below, several plugin
methods related to the generated Kotlin files have changed or been deprecated. If a method has been deprecated,
it is no longer in use by the generator and will be removed in the future.</p>


<p>We have merged the generated mapper extension methods into the same file as the mapper itself - eliminating
generated files with the word &quot;Extensions&quot; in their names. If you are regenerating code in an existing project,
you should manually delete the old generated extension files (generated Kotlin files with the word &quot;Extensions&quot;
in the file name).
</p>


<p>The generated Dynamic SQL Support class in the Kotlin runtime
has changed and now matches the recommended format published in the MyBatis Dynamic SQL documentation (it more closely
matches the style of the support class generated for Java).
This has the following benefits:</p>


<ul>
    
<li>Self-joins are now possible with the generated code</li>
    
<li>There is no longer a need to append the word &quot;Record&quot; to generated model classes</li>
    
<li>Specifying an override to rename the domain object will take effect as desired</li>
</ul>


<p><b>This update will require changes in existing code if you regenerate Kotlin code using this updated version.</b></p>


<p>Generated Kotlin data classes no longer have the word &quot;Record&quot; appended to their names. Otherwise, they are
the same. Your use of these classes will need to change. In most cases, you can simply remove the word &quot;Record&quot; from the
reference. For example, if you have a table named &quot;Bar&quot;, you may see code like this:</p>

<pre>
    import foo.BarRecord

    val bar = BarRecord(1, 2)
</pre>


<p>It will need to change to code like this:</p>

<pre>
    import foo.Bar           // remove &quot;Record&quot;

    val bar = Bar(1, 2)      // remove &quot;Record&quot;
</pre>


<p>Additionally, generated support classes now declare an instance of the <code>AliasableSqlTable</code> object,
and all fields, as values in the top level object. If you wrote custom code that used these generated objects, two
changes will be required:</p>


<ul>
    
<li>The declared <code>AliasableSqlTable</code> object is now an instance of an inner Class rather than an inner
        Object. It should be referenced with the new name (typically the same name as previously, with the first letter
        now lowercase)</li>
    
<li>References to any <code>AliasableSqlColumn</code> should reference the top level value rather than a nested
        value</li>
</ul>


<p>For example, previously code might have looked like this:</p>

<pre>
    import foo.BarDynamicSqlSupport.Bar
    import foo.BarDynamicSqlSupport.Bar.id
    import foo.BarDynamicSqlSupport.Bar.description

    val selectStatement = select(id, description) {
       from(Bar)
    }
</pre>


<p>New code should look like this:</p>

<pre>
    import foo.BarDynamicSqlSupport.bar           // use the lower case name
    import foo.BarDynamicSqlSupport.id            // import the top level field
    import foo.BarDynamicSqlSupport.description   // import the top level field

    val selectStatement = select(id, description) {
       from(bar)     // use the lower case name
    }
</pre>


<p>Lastly, the generated Kotlin code uses upgraded DSL features that should be mostly transparent. But you will notice
    that any &quot;where&quot; clauses you write will likely have deprecation warnings. This is due to a change in MyBatis
    Dynamic SQL. You can read about remediation of these warnings in the documentation for that project.
</p>

<h3>Other Enhancements</h3>

<ul>
    
<li>Added capabilities to the SerializablePlugin for Kotlin</li>
    
<li>Added the ability to specify a package for MyBatis Dynamic SQL Support Classes</li>
    
<li>Added the ability to specify a MyBatis Dynamic SQL Support class name on the table configuration</li>

<li>Added a property to &lt;columnOverride&gt; that forces the Java type into generated mappings for the
        MyBatis Dynamic SQL based runtimes. This is useful in certain cases such as when you use MyBatis'
        EnumOrdinalTypeHandler.
    </li>
</ul>

</ul>

<section><a id="New_Runtime_for_Kotlin_Using_MyBatis_Dynamic_SQL"></a>
<h3>New Runtime for Kotlin Using MyBatis Dynamic SQL</h3>

<p>MyBatis generator supports Kotlin! There is a new simple DOM for generating Kotlin. There is also a new runtime that will
generate Kotlin code that uses the MyBatis Dynamic SQL library. It has functionality that matches the new Java runtime
for MyBatis Dynamic SQL (see below) - but it uses a more idiomatic Kotlin style with receiver functions rather than the
method chaining style of the Java runtime.
</p>


<p>To use the new runtime, set <code>targetRuntime=MyBatis3Kotlin</code> on a <code>&lt;context&gt;</code>.</p>


<p>As in the Java runtime for MyBatis Dynamic SQL, there is no Example class generated and the *ByExample methods are not
generated. Rather
general count, delete, insert, selectOne, selectMany, and update methods are generated that allow where clauses and other
parts of SQL statements to be supplied via lambdas.</p>


<p>See the <a href="generatedobjects/dynamicSqlKotlin.html">MyBatis Dynamic SQL with Kotlin Usage Page</a> for further details.</p>

</section><section><a id="New_Runtime_for_MyBatis_Dynamic_SQL"></a>
<h3>New Runtime for MyBatis Dynamic SQL</h3>

<p>There is a new runtime for MyBatis Dynamic SQL. It uses improved functionality in that library and requires
version 1.1.3 or later of that library.</p>


<p>To use the new runtime, set <code>targetRuntime=MyBatis3DynamicSql</code> on a <code>&lt;context&gt;</code>.</p>


<p><b>Important:</b> Setting <code>targetRuntime=MyBatis3DynamicSql</code> will use the new runtime. If you wish to use
the original runtime, set <code>targetRuntime=MyBatis3DynamicSqlV1</code>. However, note that <b>the V1 runtime is
deprecated and will be removed in a future version</b> - so please switch to the new runtime.</p>


<p>The new runtime has enhanced capabilities:</p>

<ul>
  
<li>The *ByExample methods are removed. There is no example class generated in this runtime and the old method names
  don't make sense anymore. They are replaced
  by general count/delete/select/update methods that allow a where clause to be added via a lambda</li>
  
<li>There is a new multiple row insert method that leverages recent enhancements in MyBatis and MyBatis Dynamic SQL</li>
  
<li>There is a new selectOne method that allows you to specify a where clause via a lambda. This is convenient
  when you know that there will only be one record returned from a query - you no longer have to receive a list
  with one element</li>
  
<li>selectByPrimaryKey and selectOne return Optional&lt;R&gt; rather than an object that may be null</li>
  
<li>The new generated update method is far more flexible than the prior version. It can be used to mimic the old
   updateByExample and updateByExampleSelective methods, but it can also be used to generate update methods with any
   combination of update columns. So, for example, you can create an update statement that will insert nulls into some
   fields and ignore other fields. This has been an ongoing frustration with the prior update methods and is now resolved.</li>
</ul>


<p>See the <a href="generatedobjects/dynamicSql.html">MyBatis Dynamic SQL Usage Page</a> for further details.</p>

</section><section><a id="Breaking_API_Changes"></a>
<h3>Breaking API Changes</h3>

<ul>
  
<li>Removed Plugin methods that were specific to iBatis2 (these were the <code>clientXXXGenerated</code>
      methods that accepted a <code>TopLevelClass</code> as a parameter).</li>
  
<li>Changed the signature of the Plugin <code>clientGenerated</code> method.</li>
  
<li>Removed the <code>toXmlElement</code> methods in the configuration classes. These methods were never properly
      implemented.</li>
  
<li>In the Java DOM, the <code>Method</code> class now requires an explicit call to <code>setAbstract</code>
      to mark the method as an abstract method. This was done to support private methods in interfaces for Java9+
      code.</li>
  
<li>In the Java DOM, removed the default constructors for <code>Method</code> and <code>Field</code></li>
  
<li>Removed several methods from <code>CompilationUnit</code> including <code>isJavaInterface</code>,
      <code>isJavaEnumeration</code>, <code>getSuperClass</code>, and <code>getSuperInterfaceTypes</code>.</li>
  
<li>In the XML DOM, element nodes no longer extend the abstract Element class which is removed.</li>
  
<li>Changed return types to Optionals in the DOM methods where appropriate.</li>
  
<li>Removed the <code>getFormattedContent</code> method from all Java and XML DOM classes. These methods
      are replaced by a new set of renderer classes. Note that the new renderer classes will produce
      code that is the same as the prior methods with very few exceptions - and those exceptions are related to
      bugs in the old methods.</li>
  
<li>The attribute &quot;implementationPackage&quot; has been removed from the <code>&lt;javaClientGenerator&gt;</code>
      configuration. It was only used for iBatis.</li>
</ul>

</section><section><a id="Other_Changes"></a>
<h3>Other Changes</h3>

<ul>
  
<li>Support for iBatis2 removed</li>
  
<li>Support for parsing old Ibator configuration files removed</li>
  
<li>Removed SqlMapConfigPlugin as that was specific to iBatis2</li>
  
<li>Added ability to specify a different project and package for generated model objects</li>
  
<li>Expanded the capabilities of the Java DOM and fixed a few inconsistencies</li>
</ul>

</section></section><section><a id="Version_1.3.7"></a>
<h2>Version 1.3.7</h2>

<p>This version contains several minor fixes and enhancements - mostly related to the MyBatis3DynamicSql runtime.</p>


<p>Please reference the GitHub page for milestone 1.3.7 for details.
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mybatis/generator/issues?q=milestone%3A1.3.7" class="externalLink">Milestone 1.3.7</a>

</section><section><a id="Version_1.3.6"></a>
<h2>Version 1.3.6</h2>
</section><section><a id="Major_Enhancement"></a>
<h2>Major Enhancement</h2>

<p>The major enhancement in this release is a new type of generated code.  The generator will now create code that
is based on the <a href="https://www.mybatis.org/mybatis-dynamic-sql/docs/introduction.html" class="externalLink">MyBatis Dynamic SQL</a> library.
From the first release of MyBatis Generator, the generator has created code that includes &quot;by example&quot; support, but that support
has been limited and difficult to use.  The new style of generated code supports a more natural SQL-like syntax for WHERE clauses.
Additionally, WHERE clauses can be created with any combination of ANDs and ORs.  This is a significant improvement to the generated
code.  It comes at the cost of dependency on MyBatis Dynamic SQL, and loss of compatibility with previously generated code, but we
think it will be worth the change.  One other benefit is that the generated code is significantly smaller and easier to understand.
</p>

<p>Don't worry - unless you enable this change, then generator will create code exactly as it has in the past.</p>

<p>To enable the change, use the new &quot;MyBatis3DynamicSQL&quot; runtime on the
 <a href="configreference/context.html">&lt;context&gt;</a> configuration element.  To read more about using this new
 style of generated code, see the
  <a href="generatedobjects/dynamicSql.html">MyBatis Dynamic SQL Usage Notes</a> page.</p>

</section><section><a id="Other_Announcements"></a>
<h2>Other Announcements</h2>

<ul>
  
<li>After this release, support for iBatis2 code generation will be removed</li>
  
<li>After this release, the generator will require Java 8 to run.  It will still generate code for earlier
    Java versions, but the generator itself will require Java 8.</li>

</section><section><a id="Enhancements_1"></a>
<h3>Enhancements</h3>

<ul>
  
<li>Added a new target runtime - MyBatis3Simple - that can be used to generate
      very simple CRUD operations on tables.  This runtime produces far simpler
      MyBatis code than the normal MyBatis3 runtime.  The produced code also has
      lower functionality that the normal MyBatis3 runtime.  If you do not
      regularly use the &quot;by example&quot; methods, then the code produced by the
      MyBatis3Siple runtime may be more suitable to your project.</li>
  
<li>Added a new plugin - VirtualPrimaryKey plugin - that can be used to specify
      columns that act as a primary key, even if they are not defined as
      primary keys in the database.</li>
  
<li>Issue #328 - Added a new plugin - RowBounds plugin - that will generate an additional
      version of <code>selectByExample</code> that supports the MyBatis RowBounds
      function.</li>
  
<li>Created a new reference page for supplied plugins:
      <a href="reference/plugins.html">Supplied Plugins</a></li>
  
<li>Issue #368 - Allowed for generation of Java Model only.  If no SQLMapGenerator
      or JavaClientGenerator is specified in a context, then only a Java Model is generated.
      Also, if property &quot;modelOnly&quot; is set to &quot;true&quot; on a &lt;table&gt; element, then
      only model object and, possibly XML result maps, will be generated.
  </li>
  
<li>Issue #374 - Allow for specification of a file encoding for reading/writing
      Java files on the file system. There is a new property &quot;javaFileEncoding&quot; on the
      &lt;context&gt; element that can be used to specify a Java file encoding. (XML files
      are always read/written in UTF-8 per the spec).
  </li>
  
<li>Added the ability to specify custom code formatters for generated Java and XML files.

<h2>Version 1.3.0</h2>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
  
<li>Moved to mybatis.org, renamed MyBatis Generator</li>
  
<li>MyBatis generator will continue to support XML configuration files
      from Ibator.  However, any new features will only be implemented in
      MyBatis formatted configuration files.  Some minimal changes are required to
      migrate Ibator formatted configuration files to the new DTD for MyBatis Generator.</li>
  
<li>Configuration settings for MyBatis 3 are as follows:

</section><section><a id="Version_1.2.2_.28Never_Released.29"></a>
<h2>Version 1.2.2 (Never Released)</h2>
<section><a id="Announcements_2"></a>
<h3>Announcements</h3>

<ul>
  
<li>The <code>org.apache.ibatis.ibator.api.CommentGenerator</code> interface
      has changed.  Classes that implement this interface <b>must be changed</b>.  With
      this change, implementing classes have access to many more data elements
      from which to generate comments.  Additionally, this change makes the comment
      generator interface more consistent with the other public Ibator interfaces.
      Details of the change follow:
      
<ul>
        
<li>Methods which accepted the parameter <code>FullyQualifiedTable</code>
            now accept the parameter <code>IntrospectedTable</code> instead.
            The <code>FullyQualifiedTable</code> instance is available through
            the method <code>IntrospectedTable.getFullyQualifiedTable()</code>.
        </li>
        
<li>Methods which accepted the <code>String</code> parameter <code>columnName</code>
            now accept the parameter <code>IntrospectedColumn</code> instead.
            The column name is available through
            the method <code>IntrospectedColumn.getActualColumnName()</code>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      
<p><b>Important Note:</b> any implementation that subclasses the Ibator
      supplied class <code>DefaultCommentGenerator</code> does not need to
      change immediately with this release.
      The old methods have been deprecated and will be removed with the next
      release of Ibator - so subclasses should be reworked as soon as
      convenient.</p>
  </li>
  
<li>The SQL Map generator has changed in that it no longer prepends the string
      &quot;ibatorgenerated_&quot; to every generated XML id.  If you were relying on these
      generated names in other code, you can force Ibator to prepend the string
      with the property <code>useLegacyXMLIds</code> on the
      <a href="configreference/sqlMapGenerator.html">&lt;SqlMapGenerator&gt;</a> configuration.</li>
  
<li>Ibator is now built with Maven and includes a Maven plugin</li>

</ul>

<h3>Enhancements</h3>

<ul>
  
<li>IBATIS-569 - Modified the IbatorRules implementation to make it easier
      for plugins to provide custom implementations of IbatorRules.  See the
      Javadoc for the new class
      <code>org.apache.ibatis.ibator.internal.rules.IbatorRulesDelegate</code>
      for more information.</li>
  
<li>IBATIS-571 - Added support for automatically delimiting SQL keywords
      if they are used as column names in tables.  See the
      <a href="configreference/ibatorContext.html">&lt;ibatorContext&gt;</a> page
      for more information.</li>
  
<li>IBATIS-577 - Define SQL fragments for column lists to improve
      reusability of generated code.  Thanks to Iwao AVE! for the idea
      and the initial patch.
  </li>
  
<li>Added new <code>-verbose</code> command line argument.  See the
     <a href="running.html">Running Ibator</a> page
      for more information.</li>
  
<li>Added logging statements for use in debug. See the
     <a href="reference/logging.html">Logging</a> page
      for more information.</li>
  
<li>Added new example plugin to demonstrate adding case-insensitive LIKE
      support to generated Example classes.  See the
     <a href="configreference/ibatorPlugin.html">&lt;ibatorPlugin&gt;</a> page
      for more information.</li>
  
<li>Added &quot;delimitAllColumns&quot; attribute to table configurations.  This supports databases
      like PosgreSQL that are case-sensitive for identifiers. See the
     <a href="configreference/table.html">&lt;table&gt;</a> page
      for more information.</li>
  
<li>Added a page explaining how to deal with case sensitivity in PostgreSQL.  See the
     <a href="usage/postgresql.html">PostgreSQL</a> page
      for more information.</li>
  
<li>IBATIS-586 - Added the ability to specify nested property elements on columnOverrides.
      See the <a href="configreference/columnOverride.html">&lt;columnOverride&gt;</a> page
      for more information. Thanks to Dan Turkenkopf for the idea and a nice initial patch.</li>
  
<li>The IntrospectedColumn class now contains any column remarks returned during
      database introspection. This may be useful for some CommentGenerators.</li>
  
<li>IBATIS-592 - Added attributes to IntrospectedTable that contain the calculated
      SqlMap namespace, and the calculated runtime table names.  These can now be overridden in
      plugins.</li>
  
<li>Fixed addCriterionfor JDBC* methods so that they all do a null check.</li>
  
<li>Fixed IbatorRunner so that configuration errors are shown (thanks to Karel Rank)</li>

<h3>Enhancements</h3>

<ul>
  
<li>Ibator now includes a plugin mechanism.  This mechanism can be used to
      add to or modify the code generated by Ibator.  If you have previously
      extended one of Abator's code generators to change their behavior, we
      strongly suggest that you move to a plugin.  See the
      <a href="configreference/ibatorPlugin.html">&lt;ibatorPlugin&gt;</a> page
      for detailed information.</li>
  
<li>Ibator ships with the following plugins:
    
<ul>
      
<li>A plugin that will generate an SQL Map Config File
        (<code>org.apache.ibatis.ibator.plugins.SqlMapConfigPlugin</code>)
      </li>
      
<li>A plugin that will make generated model classes Serializable
        (<code>org.apache.ibatis.ibator.plugins.SerializablePlugin</code>)
      </li>
      
<li>A plugin that will add <code>equals</code> and <code>hashCode</code>
        methods to generated model classes
        (<code>org.apache.ibatis.ibator.plugins.EqualsHashCodePlugin</code>)
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
<li>Added support for &quot;runtimeCatalog&quot; and &quot;runtimeSchema&quot; properties to the
      <a href="configreference/table.html">&lt;table&gt;</a>
      configuration element.  Thanks to Dan Turkenkopf for the idea and the
      patch!</li>
  
<li>New generated method - insertSelective.  This method will allow you to use
      column defaults on a table definition on insert</li>
  
<li>Added the ability to specify a that DAO implementation classes be in a
      separate package from the DAO interface classes.</li>
</ul>

</section><section><a id="Changes_from_Abator"></a>
<h3>Changes from Abator</h3>

<p>There are several breaking changes between Ibator and Abator.  This list
details the changes, and has methods of resolving the differences.</p>

<ul>
  
<li>JSE 5.0 or higher is required for Ibator</li>
  
<li>Ibator does not contain the &quot;legacy&quot; code generators from Abator.  You must
      choose &quot;Ibatis2Java2&quot; or &quot;Ibatis2Java5&quot; as a target runtime - and code generated from
      Ibator is compatible with iBATIS version 2.2.0 or higher only.  If you are
      using an earlier version of iBATIS - upgrade!  If you are not able to upgrade,
      then you must continue to use Abator.</li>
  
<li>The classloading strategy in Ibator is changed from Abator.  In all cases, we now recommend
      specifying the classpath external to Ibator, and we further recommend that you do not use
      the <code>&lt;classPathEntry&gt;</code> element.  You may specify classpath entries
      if you feel you must, but those entries will only be used when loading JDBC drivers
      of Java model root classes.  If you write a custom extension to Ibator, or a plugin,
      you must specify that classpath entry external to Ibator.</li>
  
<li>The API for extending Ibator is significantly changed from Abator.
      In most cases, implementations of the old Abator interfaces should
      be converted to Ibator plugins.  See the
      <a href="reference/extending.html">Extending Ibator</a> for more information.</li>
  
<li>The <code>afterXXXGenerationHook</code> methods have been removed from
      all Ibator supplied implementations of the core interfaces.  If you
      were extending an Ibator supplied implementation to make use of these methods,
      then you <em>must</em> migrate your code to an Ibator plugin.</li>
  
<li>The build has been significantly modified and now includes an Emma based
      code coverage report.</li>
  
<li>Changes to the XML configuration file are required.  See the
      <a href="migratingFromAbator.html">Migrating from Abator</a> page for detailed
      information</li>
</ul>

</section></section><section><a id="Version_1.1.0"></a>
<h2>Version 1.1.0</h2>
<section><a id="Announcements_4"></a>
<h3>Announcements</h3>

<ul>
  
<li>The next release of Abator will require JRE 5.0 or higher.</li>
  
<li>Java2 is now the default generator set.  This will cause different code to be
      generated if you have not specified a generator set previously.  To remedy this,
      set the generator set to &quot;Legacy&quot;.</li>
</ul>

</section><section><a id="New_Generated_Methods"></a>
<h3>New Generated Methods</h3>

<p>Abator will generate these new methods:</p>

<dl>
  
<dt><b>countByExample</b></dt>
  
<dd>This method will return an integer representing the number of rows in a table
      that match the given criteria.</dd>
  
<dt><b>updateByExample</b></dt>
  
<dd>This method will update all rows in a table that match a given criteria.  This method is
      available in the Java2 and Java5 generator sets only.  There is also a &quot;selective&quot; version
      of the method that only updates certain columns of a table (the selective version of this
      method is probably the more useful version to use in most situations).</dd>
</dl>

</section><section><a id="Bugs_Fixed_5"></a>
<h3>Bugs Fixed</h3>

<ul>
  
<li>Fixed bug for corner case where a criteria class is created, but no criteria
      are set.</li>
  
<li>Fixed a bug that caused the JavaModelGenerator's &quot;trimStrings&quot; property to fail</li>
  
<li>Fixed the XML file merger so that internal entities are preserved</li>
  
<li>Fixed the XML configuration parser so that external entities are handled properly</li>
  
<li>Fixed bug - incorrect datatype mapping for JDBC BIT datatype</li>
  
<li>Fixed bug where Abator generated incorrect properties for certain database columns
      (for example, if the column name is I_NAME)</li>
</ul>

</section><section><a id="Miscellaneous_Changes"></a>
<h3>Miscellaneous Changes</h3>

<ul>
  
<li>Added the ability to specify properties to ignore qualifiers and change runtime
      table names in the generated SQL for a table.  Primary use cases for this
      support include:
      
<ul>
        
<li>Generating objects for a table that has a public synonym or alias</li>
        
<li>Generating objects for a table that exists in many schemas, and the
            schema will be selected at runtime</li>
      </ul>
    See the <a href="configreference/table.html">&lt;table&gt;</a>
    reference page for more information, or the
    <a href="usage/oracle.html">Oracle</a> reference page for an example.</li>
  
<li>Added support for delimiting SQL identifiers for the use cases where identifiers
      contain spaces or SQL reserved words.
      See the <a href="configreference/table.html">&lt;table&gt;</a>,
      <a href="configreference/abatorContext.html">&lt;abatorContext&gt;</a>,
      and <a href="configreference/columnOverride.html">&lt;columnOverride&gt;</a>
      reference pages for more information.</li>
  
<li>Added SYBASE dialect for generated keys.
      See the <a href="configreference/generatedKey.html">&lt;generatedKey&gt;</a>
      reference page for more information.</li>
  
<li>Added DB2_MF (DB2 on Main Frames) dialect for generated keys.
      See the <a href="configreference/generatedKey.html">&lt;generatedKey&gt;</a>
      reference page for more information.</li>
  
<li>Abator will now automatically escape identifiers that contain the $ or # characters
      as these characters have special meaning in iBATIS configuration files.</li>
  
<li>Added a <code>clear</code> method to the generated example classes (in the Java2 and Java5
      generator sets only).  This allows reuse of these classes.</li>
  
<li>Added the ability to specify that result maps should use column indexes rather
      than column names in the result mappings.  Primary use cases for this
      support include:
      
<ul>
        
<li>When tables have columns whose name is only differentiated by
            case (e.g. &quot;first name&quot; and &quot;First Name&quot;)</li>
        
<li>When you want to make the selects as fast as possible (there is a slight
            performance benefit when using column indexes)</li>
      </ul>
    See the <a href="configreference/table.html">&lt;table&gt;</a>
    reference page for more information.</li>
  
<li>Made the generated Example and Criteria classes extendable.  Added some documentation
      about how to extend these classes.  See the
      <a href="generatedobjects/extendingExampleClass.html">Extending the Example Classes</a>
      reference page for more information.</li>
  
<li>Made the legacy DAOs extendable.</li>
  
<li>Added the ability to provide a renaming rule for columns.  This is for the
      use case where columns have a common prefix that should be removed before
      calculating the property name.  See the
      <a href="configreference/columnRenamingRule.html">&lt;columnRenamingRule&gt;</a>
      reference page for more information.</li>
  
<li>Added support for persisting a configuration to XML - this to enable
      a graphical editor in the future.</li>
  
<li>Add afterXXXGenerationHook() methods in all generators to enable adding
      extra Java code or XML elements to any generated object.  This will make
      it easier to create customized generators.</li>
  
<li>API change to allow generating with selected contexts rather than
      the entire config file.</li>
  
<li>API change to allow generating with selected tables rather than
    the entire config file.</li>
  
<li>Exposed new support for selecting tables and/or contexts to the
      command line and the Ant task - this has added an advanced syntax to the command
      line for Abator.  See the
      <a href="running.html">Running Abator</a> reference page for more information.</li>
  
<li><code>rootClass</code> and <code>rootInterface</code> may now be specified for each table.
      See the <a href="configreference/table.html">&lt;table&gt;</a>
      reference page for more information.</li>
  
<li>If a <code>rootClass</code> is specified for any table, Abator will now check in the
      rootClass to see if a generated property already exists in the root class.  If it does,
      Abator will not generate the property.  The &lt;javaModelGenerator&gt; element now
      accepts a property to specify the classpath of the <code>rootClass</code>.  See the
      <a href="configreference/javaModelGenerator.html">&lt;javaModelGenerator&gt;</a>
      reference page for more information.  Thanks to Ashok Madhavan for the beginnings
      of this code.</li>
  
<li>Allowed specifying a type (pre or post) for the generated key element.  See the
      <a href="configreference/generatedKey.html">&lt;generatedKey&gt;</a>
      reference page for more information.</li>
  
<li>Added a comment generator interface to enable generation of custom comments.
      See the <a href="configreference/commentGenerator.html">&lt;commentGenerator&gt;</a>
      reference page for more information.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 1.0.0</h2>
<section><a id="Generator_Sets"></a>
<h3>Generator Sets</h3>

<p>A generator set is a set of
code generators (SQL Map Generator, Java Model Generator, DAO Generator, and Java Type Resolver).
Abator now ships three different generator sets.  The generated code from these three
generator sets is slightly different, and the use of the generated objects is slightly
different too.  The concepts are exactly the same.  With the newer generator sets, the
&quot;by example&quot; methods have been vastly improved.  It is now possible to generate
<b>virtually any</b> WHERE clause (including IN and BETWEEN predicates).  Lastly, the new
generator sets generate much more concise code - the DAOs and SQL Maps are of
normal size, and there are no extraneous methods.  The example class in the new generator
sets encapsulates all the function needed to generate dynamic queries.</p>

<p>The three generator sets shipped with Abator are as follows:</p>

<dl>
  
<dt>Legacy</dt>
  
<dd>This generator set generates code that is the same as previous versions of
      Abator.  There are some limitations with this generator set, and we strongly
      recommend that you choose one of the other sets.  However, this set remains
      the default for now.  <b>This generator set will likely be removed in a future
      version of Abator.</b></dd>
  
<dt>Java2</dt>
  
<dd>This generator set generates code that is compatible with iBATIS versions 2.2.0 and
      higher.  With this generator set the &quot;by example&quot; methods are much more powerful
      than in the legacy set.  It is now possible to generate
      virtually unlimited SQL WHERE clauses with Abator generated code (including &quot;IN&quot;
      and &quot;BETWEEN&quot; clauses).  <b>This generator set will likely become the default set in a
      future version of Abator.</b></dd>
  
<dt>Java5</dt>
  
<dd>This generator set has the same capabilities as the Java2 generator set with the
      added feature of generating code that is JSE 5.0 compliant using parameterized
      types and annotations.</dd>
</dl>

<p><b>Important:</b> code generated with the Java2 or Java5 generator sets is not 100%
compatible with code generated with the Legacy set - especially in the use of the
&quot;by example&quot; methods.  Also note that the &quot;by example&quot; methods in these generator sets rely
on iBATIS dynamic SQL support that is missing in iBATIS versions prior to version 2.2.0.</p>

<p>A generator set is selected with the <code>generatorSet</code> attribute of the
<code>&lt;abatorContext&gt;</code> element.  See the
<a href="configreference/abatorContext.html">&lt;abatorContext&gt;</a> reference page for
more information.</p>


<p>Use of the example classes is different with the different generator sets.  See the
<a href="generatedobjects/exampleClassUsage.html">Example Class Usage</a> page for more
information.</p>

</section><section><a id="Model_Types"></a>
<h3>Model Types</h3>

<p>A model type is used to give you more control over the types of domain objects
generated by Abator.  Abator now supports three different types of domain models
as follows:</p>

<dl>
  
<dt>conditional</dt>
  
<dd>This model is similar to the hierarchical model except that a separate
    class will not be generated if that separate class would only contain
    one field.  So if a table has only one primary key field, that field
    will be merged into the base record class.  This model type is the default.
    <b>Note that this model type may generate classes that are not 100%
    with classes generated in previous versions of Abator.</b></dd>
  
<dt>flat</dt>
  
<dd>This model generates only one domain class for any table.  The class
     will hold all fields in the table.</dd>
  
<dt>hierarchical</dt>
  
<dd>This model is the same as the model shipped with the initial versions
      of Abator.  This model will generate a primary key class if the table has
      a primary key, another class that holds any BLOB columns in the table, and
      another class that holds the remaining fields.  There is an appropriate
      inheritance relationship between the classes.</dd>
</dl>


<p>Model types can be specified as a default for an entire context, and you may
override the default for each table in a context.  See the
<a href="configreference/abatorContext.html">&lt;abatorContext&gt;</a> reference page for
more information about setting the context default.
See the <a href="configreference/table.html">&lt;table&gt;</a>
reference page for more information about setting a model type for specific tables.
</p>

<p><b>Important:</b> the default value is conditional - this is a non-backward compatible
change from previous versions of Abator.</p>

</section><section><a id="updateByPrimaryKeySelective"></a>
<h3>updateByPrimaryKeySelective</h3>

<p>This is a new mapped SQL statement, and new DAO method, that will only
update columns whose corresponding properties in the parameter class are non-null.
This can be used to update certain
columns in a record without needing to update the entire record.
</p>

<p><b>Important:</b> any column that is mapped to a primitive type
will always be updated.</p>

</section><section><a id="Miscellaneous_Changes_1"></a>
<h3>Miscellaneous Changes</h3>

<ul>
  
<li>Added the ability to specify a table alias.  This aids in reuse of generated
    SQL map elements.  See the <a href="configreference/table.html">&lt;table&gt;</a>
    reference page for more information.</li>
  
<li>Fixed the XML file merger so that extraneous blank lines at the end of the
      file are removed.</li>
  
<li>Added the ability to specify a type handler for table columns.
    See the <a href="configreference/columnOverride.html">&lt;columnOverride&gt;</a>
    reference page for more information.</li>
  
<li>Added the ability to specify the visibility of the DAO &quot;by example&quot; methods.
    This allows you to make the methods private for internal use only.
    See the <a href="configreference/javaClientGenerator.html">&lt;javaClientGenerator&gt;</a>
    reference page for more information.</li>
  
<li>Added the ability to override the naming convention for DAO method names.
    See the <a href="configreference/javaClientGenerator.html">&lt;javaClientGenerator&gt;</a>
    reference page for more information.</li>
  
<li>Added the ability to specify wildcards for schema or tableName in a table
      configuration.  This will allow generation of many tables with a simple
      XML configuration.
    See the <a href="configreference/table.html">&lt;table&gt;</a>
    reference page for more information.</li>
  
<li>Added the ability to escape wildcard characters in schema or table names
      if required by the driver.  See the <a href="configreference/table.html">&lt;table&gt;</a>
      reference page for more information.</li>
  
<li>Added the ability to suppress JSE 5.0 type warning messages for non-parameterized
      types if you are using the Legacy or Java2 generator sets in a JSE 5.0 environment.
    See the <a href="configreference/abatorContext.html">&lt;abatorContext&gt;</a>
    reference page for more information.
  </li>
  
<li>Added the ability to specify an external properties file for passing
    parameters into an Abator configuration file (like the iBATIS properties
    file).  See the <a href="configreference/properties.html">&lt;properties&gt;</a>
    reference page for more information.
  </li>
  
<li>The Ant task now supports a &quot;verbose&quot; attribute.  See the
    <a href="running.html">Running Abator</a> page for more information.
  </li>
  
<li>The Ant task now supports a nested property set for passing values into
      an Abator configuration file.  See the
     <a href="running.html">Running Abator</a> page for more information.
  </li>
</ul>
